A lightweight foundational diffusion model (1.4M params) that generates 8-bit game sprites. Built from scratch with a custom architecture, trained on just **894 images**. This repository features the architecture, data, and source code for both the training and inference.

This repository is mostly meant for **experimental and educational purposes**. It does not include any production ready code or functional use cases.

## Features
* 894-image dataset of 8bit video game assets
* Implementation Unet architecture in TensorFlow
* Hyperparameter Tuning using keras_tuner
* Custom training and test loops
* DDPM & DDIM sampling / inference
* Saving and loading options
* Visualization (png, gifs)

## Setup
All of the relevant training and inference code is contained within a self sustained jupyter notebook (**notebooks/main_notebook.ipynb**). The notebook is organized with headings and descriptions on how to train a new model or load the pre-trained model and run inference. So all you need to do is:
1. clone the repository 
2. Download dependencies and libraries required from "requirements.txt"
3. Run notebooks/main_notebook.ipynb

Repository structure
* Data - features the 849-image dataset used to train the model
* Generations - features pre-generated samples using the model
* images - some image extracts
* notebooks - features the main self-contained notebook which contains the implementation
* util - some utility .py scripts to download and visualize samples
* weights - the weights and configs of pre-trained models
* architecture.jpg - the model architecture (high def image)

Note: The model was trained using the directml plugin of tensorflow to leverage AMD GPUs. This plugin only works with tensorflowâ€“cpu==2.10. More info here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/gpu-tensorflow-plugin
